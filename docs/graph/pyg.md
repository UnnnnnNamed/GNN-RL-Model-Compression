## Supported packages
GNN-RL support popular deep graph neural network package, such as [Torch-Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/).
In this section we will give examples to modeling DNN's topology to computational graph, and embedding them using graph neural network.
